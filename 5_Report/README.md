# Automatic Water Barrel Filler
It automates refilling a water barrel used for watering a small garden greenhouse. They didn’t want to plug in a pump every few hours only to have turn it off again ten minutes later when it has filled up again. So I’ve scavenged some stuff that I had lying around to create a project and decided to make a instructable.
I also did not want the pump to switch on/off every second because of the water level jumping above and below a certain threshold. To fix this I used 2 float switches, one which is the maximum water level and one forthe minimum water level.

# Supplies
Electronics:

1x ATmega328P Xplained Mini with cable for programming  

2x polypropylene float switch  

1x 5v relay module 1-channel (i used a KY-019)  

3x male to female jumpers

# Bigger bits:

1x old outlet power strip

1x water barrel

1x submersible pump with waterhose

1x powerbank to power the ATmega328P

1x plastic container to put the electronics in and keep them dry

2x small triangle bracket or similar to mount the float switches on  

# Tools:

stuff to keep everything together with (duct tape, hotglue, screws)

tools to remove bits of hard plastic (stanley knife, chisel, drill or something similar)

screwdrivers

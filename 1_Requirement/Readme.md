# Introduction: 
Automatic water barrel filler automates refilling a water barrel used for watering a small garden greenhouse. With this project there is no need to plug in a pump every few hours only to have turn it off again. The barrel fills up until the top float switch is pushed up and wait until the bottom float switch goes down for the plugged in pump to turn on again

# 4W 1H:

WHAT : Automatic water barrel filler.  
Where : In small garden greenhouse.  
When : When there is need of frequent switching of pump.  
How : By using microcontroller with power strip.

# SWOT Analysis: 
 
 Strength : The system is reliable . There is no need of manual operation.  
 Weakness : Make sure the power strip is not plugged in while working on it.  
 Opportunities : Tech based market always attract the youth  
 Threat : Slower growth in an innovation always threat in thus dynamic world
 
 # High Level Requirement  
 1.They did not want the pump to switch on/off every second because of the water level jumping above and below a certain threshold  
To fix this I used 2 float switches, one which is the maximum water level and one forthe minimum water level. 
2.They did not want to plug in a pump every few hour  
So to contro the operation microcontroller is used   

# Low Level Requirement  
You need enough wiring so that you can reach the relay and go back to the original connection point.

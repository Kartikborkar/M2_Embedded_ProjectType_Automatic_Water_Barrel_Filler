# Introduction:
Automatic water barrel filler automates refilling a water barrel used for watering a small garden greenhouse. With this project there is no need to plug in a pump every few hours only to have turn it off again. The barrel fills up until the top float switch is pushed up and wait until the bottom float switch goes down for the plugged in pump to turn on again.
